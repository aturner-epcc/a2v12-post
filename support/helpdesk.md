# ARCHER2 Helpdesk

The ARCHER2 Helpdesk is the first point of contact for all questions relating to the ARCHER2 Service. Support is available Monday to Friday from 08:00 until 18:00, excluding UK public holidays. The ARCHER2 Helpdesk can be reached by:

- Email support@archer2.ac.uk
- via ARCHER SAFE https://www.archer.ac.uk/safe
- phone: +44 (0)131 650 5000
- if the above number unavailable due to University of Edinburgh switchboard issues, please use +44(0)131 618 8313
- By post, to:

```
ARCHER2 Helpdesk
EPCC
Bayes Centre
47 Potterrow
Edinburgh EH8 9BT
```

Please try and provide as much background information as possible as this will speed up the processing time considerably. Existing ARCHER2 users will be asked for their user ID, project code, and, where applicable, the commands they are using and the error message they get.

## How the helpdesk ticket system works

When a query is submitted by email or through the SAFE, it is placed in the SAFE query system. Phone queries are entered into the system by the helpdesk operator.

When you email your query, you will normally get an automatic acknowledgement by email, including a tracking ID, within a few minutes. If you submit your query through SAFE, it will give you a tracking ID at once. A few minutes later, your query will be assigned to the appropriate expert within the ARCHER team to handle.

The expert may contact you to discuss your problem or to get extra information. Finally, the expert will send you an answer, and the query will be closed. At this point the helpdesk will send you another message, telling you that this has happened.

Closed queries are kept in the SAFE database, so that we can refer back to them when solving future problems, and when writing documentation, etc. The SAFE database is protected by [ARCHER Personal Data and Privacy Policy](../../privacy.html).
