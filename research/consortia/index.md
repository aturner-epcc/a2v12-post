summary: Scientific Consortia
---

EPSRC and NERC fund a number of large consortia that bring together computational scientists working in a particular scientific area. These consortia have large allocations of time on ARCHER that they can distribute out to their members.

These pages provide information on the consortia funded on ARCHER including details of how to contact them and information on the scientific area they cover.
