title: ARCHER2 Virtual Tutorials and Webinars
summary: Online learning
---


This section contains details on the virtual tutorials and webinars offered by the ARCHER2 service.

These virtual sessions usually take place at 15:00 UK time on Wednesdays.

The virtual tutorials and webinars are live online interactive sessions conducted using Blackboard Collaborate. As well as presenting on selected topics in high-performance computing relevant to ARCHER users and reporting on scientific software development work done as part of ARCHER eCSE projects, these sessions provide a forum for users to ask questions on any topic related to the ARCHER service. They also provide an opportunity for attendees of recent ARCHER training courses to ask questions that may have arisen since attending the course.

Webinars usually have a presentation followed by the opportunity for attendees to ask questions.

Virtual tutorials normally start with a presentation and live demonstration on a particular topic followed by time for discussion with participants, both about the presented materials and in response to general questions about ARCHER and HPC/parallel computing in general. We hope that the discussions will be driven by what users wish to know and we expect the format to be that of a Question and Answer (Q&A) session. 

## Upcoming Sessions

 Chrome or Firefox are recommended for connecting to BlackBoard Collaborate but most other modern browsers will work to attend a session - please see our BlackBoard Collaborate page for more information and advice on testing your connection prior to the tutorial.
 There are also apps available for BlackBoard Collaborate but these have reduced functionality and we recommend using the browser where this is an option.

BlackBoard provide lots of help and documentation if you have any questions or issues.
