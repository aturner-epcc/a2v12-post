summary: ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) support

&nbsp;

Through a series of regular calls, Embedded CSE (eCSE) support provides funding to the ARCHER2 user community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on the ARCHER2 service. The funding allows the employment of a Research Software Engineer (RSE) to carry out software development of ARCHER2 software. This development work may include the implementation of algorithmic improvements, improvements to scalability, portability, sustainability or maintainability, or may include the addition of new functionality to a code which in turn will allow new science to be carried out.

The RSE may be based at the institution of the PI, at a third party institution, or can include staff from the centralised CSE support team, or the project may use a mixture of the above.

The first eCSE call will open shortly and will be announced on the [calls](calls/) page.

The list of all previous eCSE projects funded under the ARCHER service can be found on the funded [eCSE projects](http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/eCSE/eCSE-projects.php) page.
