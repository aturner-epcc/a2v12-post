Dear ARCHER Users,

UK Research and Innovation welcomed the Chancellor's recent announcement of funding for the next national supercomputer, ARCHER2.

A procurement tender has been issued to identify supplier(s) for the service. This will progress over the next 12 months or so as we work with potential suppliers to deliver an all-inclusive system that will allow a significant increase in scientific throughput compared to ARCHER.

As is to be expected in a large project, at the point of transition from ARCHER to ARCHER2 next year, there is highly likely to be a significant break in service provision during the installation period in Spring 2020 where neither ARCHER nor ARCHER2 will be available for use.

The specific details of the level of disruption will become clearer when we have selected the preferred supplier in Autumn 2019. By anticipating this disruption now, we want to ensure that users are given as much notice as possible to plan their work accordingly. Initial estimates suggest that the downtime of the service could be up to 11 weeks in the period February to May 2020.

As the project progresses we will be looking to mitigate the impact of service disruption, by looking at where alternative compute capability may be available. At this stage, the exact dates for disruption are still to be confirmed however we will be updating the community with more information when it is available, and regular updates will be issued on the ARCHER website.

The research communities' patience is appreciated as we work to design, develop and build the new ARCHER2 system and we will continue to update the community as the project progresses. We kindly ask users not to request additional information on the downtime, as specific details will be provided once available.
